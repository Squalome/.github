# Sharknado ðŸ¦ˆ

## Overview

Sharknado is a platform where users can participate in anonymous surveys, authenticate NFT ownership via zk proofs, and win rewards in a pseudo-anonymous and randomized bounty system. 


## Repositories

- [Main Repo](https://github.com/Squalome)
- [Semaphore Repo](https://github.com/Squalome/Sharknado_Semaphore)

**Note**: We faced an issue merging our repos, so we're submitting both. Contracts are deployed on the Gnosis mainnet.

## Technologies & Bounties

### PSE/Semaphore

Used Semaphore to authenticate NFT ownership via ZK proofs. Check out the deployed subgraphs [here](https://thegraph.com/studio/subgraph/sharknadosemaphoregraph).

### Gnosis

Although we initially aimed to use Swansky, we changed paths due to compatibility issues. But we're live on mainnet!

### The Graph

Deployed subgraphs for contract monitoring. Check the queries [here](https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/54895/sharknadograph/version/latest).

### BUIDLGUIDL

We used Scaffold-ETH2 as a boilerplate.

## Design & UX

- **Brand Concept**: Colors like "Navy Blue" and "Aquagreen" to evoke an oceanic vibe.
- **UX Mechanics**: Onboarding, gamification, and progress bars for an engaging user experience.
